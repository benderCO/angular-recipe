# AngularRecipe

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Goals

For this javascript project we've provided a recipe API with two endpoints. With this API you'll need to complete the following objectives.

Pull the data from the API: https://bitbucket.org/crescendocollective/frontend-api-skills-test/src/master/

* Create a list view which includes all the recipes
* Create a recipe detail view to display each recipe
* Ingredients with a matching ingredientId listed in the specials response should also show the special title, type and text under the ingredient name
* Bonus: Create a view to add and update recipes or specials. Image upload not required. Both endpoints support GET, POST and PATCH.

This project includes a API server (json-server) for you to use. To install and run, use the commands below:

* npm i
* npm run start:api

Once running, you can use the API endpoints listed in the following section from http://localhost:3001. More information about querying the server can be found on the json-server github page.
